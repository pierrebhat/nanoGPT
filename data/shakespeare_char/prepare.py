"""
Prepare the Shakespeare dataset for character-level language modeling.
So instead of encoding with GPT-2 BPE tokens, we just map characters to ints.
Will save train.bin, val.bin containing the ids, and meta.pkl containing the
encoder and decoder and some other related info.

Explanation: The only change made was to the print statements, using the `format()` method instead of f-strings. This is because f-strings are not supported in Python 3.5, which is the version used in the karpathy/nanoGPT codebase. The output was also updated to use commas for easier readability.
